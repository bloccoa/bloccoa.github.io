    <h2>This is a small resume of the stuff i've done since 2016 (that's around 8 years) on Roblox</h2>

    <h2>
        Over the course of ~8 years i've learned how to create roblox games, and also
        script really well with luau. Also while creating
        roblox games i managed to learn 3D gfx tricks, lighting rules using hardcore
        roblox tactics/blender

        A build to survive game involving living timebombs
        <br />
        As (former) main developer and creator, I have programmed most of the base game (Building, Explosions, Shop,
        Round stuff etc), done all the UI work
        (excluding some textures), done some particle effects (later replaced), game design things, etc
        <br />
        I later stepped down to focus on other projects and transfered ownership to a friend of mine
